Before anything, please have a basic understanding of JavaScript, have the most up-to-date version of Node.js installed, and join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kvWncZx).

##Where to start

If you'd like to contribute to the project but don't know where to start, a perfect place to look first is the current open quest. Quests are goals set up by the primary contributors to Nameless and state what we're currently trying to add to her as well as keeps track of our current progress on the objective that won't be reflected in commits.

##Creating issues and pull requests

If you notice a problem we've glossed over or have a more efficient way of doing something we haven't gotten around to simplifying yet, feel free to create either an issue or pull request. When doing this, please be descriptive, give examples of snippits that are causing issues or that you've changed, and be minimalistic when providing snippits.

Additionally, when creating pull requests, never change variable names.
